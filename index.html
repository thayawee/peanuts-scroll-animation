        <div class="description">
          Snoopy is not your average beagle. He is a book lover and a book
          writer. He is a collector of fine art and a root beer connoisseur.
          Plus, his unstoppable imagination helps keep his life anything but
          ordinary. As the Flying Ace, he heroically battles the Red Baron. As
          Joe Cool, he is the big dog on campus. But no imaginary adventure
          matches a nap on his doghouse and waking up to a well-deserved supper
          made especially for him by that Round-Headed Kid.

          "Snoopy’s whole personality is a little bittersweet. But he’s a very
          strong character. He can win or lose, be a disaster, a hero, or
          anything, and yet it all works out. I like the fact that when he’s in
          real trouble, he can retreat into a fantasy." <br />

          Good ol’ Charlie Brown is loyal, determined, and just a bit
          wishy-washy. He’s a true friend, a dedicated baseball manager, and
          very responsible when it comes to taking care of his dog, Snoopy.
          Charlie Brown never gives up, even when he probably should. He is kind
          and patient by nature, and wears his heart on his sleeve. He likes
          helping others, but try as he might, he just can’t seem to help
          himself.

          *sigh*. Never fall in love with a musician.
